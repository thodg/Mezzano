Everything below 0000008000000000 (512G) is assumed to be wired.

The function area
--------

The wired and normal function areas both begin at 0000008000000000 and are
expanded downwards for the wired area and upward for the normal area.
The total combined size of the function areas cannot exceed 2GB.
This allows wired & normal functions to reach each other through normal
direct calls, which have a maximum range of +/-2GB.
ARM64 branches have a limit of +/-128MB, so the total size of the function
area is a little more limited, but this still seems to be enough.

The base address is chosen so it stradles the wired & pinned zones.
This is not a specific requirement, but was done to minimize disruption
to code which assumes the location of wired memory.

The entire function area will eventually be subject to the full write barrier.
Supervisor code must not write to it.
NX will eventually be applied to all memory outside the function area, to
assist with catching wild jumps.

Mark bits
----------
Every two words of memory has a mark bit assigned to it so that objects
do not need to have a mark bit in their header.
