(defvar *eval-hook* 'mezzano.full-eval:eval-in-lexenv

lexical environment in which to evaluate it and returns the result
of evaluating it.

'mezzano.fast-eval:eval-in-lexenv
  An evaluator that uses the compiler to evaluate complicated forms,
  supposedly faster.
'mezzano.full-eval:eval-in-lexenv
  A metacircular evaluator that completely implements the Common Lisp
  special forms. It does not rely on the compiler.")
